<h1>How the Internet works</h1>
<hr>
<h2> DNS - Domain Name System</h2>
<p> DNS is a system that deals with the server available in the world. It translates domain names like google.com into
    IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network.It acts like internet's phonebook.</p><br>
<hr>
<h2>ISP- Internet Server Provider</h2>
<p>An ISP connects you to the internet and gives access to DNS servers, which translates domain name to IP
    addresses.Once the DNS finds the IP, the ISP routes the request by the user to the server where the domain's data is
    stored, and then delivers that data back the the user's device.<br>
    Example for ISP: Jiofiber, BSNL, ACT etc</p>

    resources from the server over a network. The server responds by by providing the required data or resources.</p>
