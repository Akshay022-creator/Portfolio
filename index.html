    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Akshay Kaushik, a passionate and ambitious individual driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to
        build impactful solutions. I believe that the world is full of possibilities, and I strive to explore them
        through constant learning, experimentation, and innovation. <br> 
        <br>
        I have a strong interest in technology, startups, freelancing, and game development, and I’m on a journey to
        transform my ideas into reality. I see technology as more than just tools — to me, it’s a way to solve
        real-world problems, create value, and make a difference. Whether it’s designing apps, developing games, or
        brainstorming startup ideas, I enjoy taking on challenges and turning imagination into something tangible.
        <br> 
        <br> Currently, I’m focused on learning, building, and growing. I believe in self-driven education and love
        exploring
        emerging technologies. My journey has already introduced me to fields like software development, AI, game
        engines, and no-code platforms like Bubble, where I’m experimenting with creating a supportive social platform
        to bring people together and make a positive impact.
